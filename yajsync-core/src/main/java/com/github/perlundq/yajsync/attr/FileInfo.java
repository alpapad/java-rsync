/**
 * A class containing generic file information for any type of file (regular,

 *
 * Warning: not designed to be implemented or extended externally.
 *
 * Use attrs() to determine the actual file type. If possible, a more specific
 * subtype will be used, representing symbolic links (SymlinkInfo) and device
 * files (DeviceInfo) respectively. But in some circumstances a symbolic link or
 * device file might be represented as a regular FileInfo - if it is a symlink
 * and lacks information about symlink target or if it is a device file and
 * lacks information about major and minor number.
 *
 * Also, if the file has a local path representation, an as specific as possible
 * instance of LocatableFileInfo will be used.
